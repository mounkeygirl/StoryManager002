    James is attending the school. She meets Henrietta and they become fast friends.

    James is somewhat reluctant to state her sources but she's decently well informed as to several events in the magical world.
    She's feeling weird about being less important then her little sisters in the magical world, and dosen't want to be overshadowed by them.
