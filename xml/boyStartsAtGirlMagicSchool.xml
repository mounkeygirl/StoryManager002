  <text>
    The boy twin attends the magic school cross-dressing as a girl in order to get in.
    He's pumped about the idea of learning magic but this is an all girls' school. If he gets caught he'll be expelled.
    He's challanged very quickly to a fashion contest, and realizes that this is a normal occurance at this school.
    It's standard practice here to use one's magic to transform verious objects into clothing.
